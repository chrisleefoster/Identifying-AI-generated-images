# BDA-Project
This is the code from my class project for CS 7265 - Big Data Analytics  

In this project, I implement the network described in [CIFAKE Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10409290) and explore it's effectiveness on different image datasets. This project consists of two files: a python script and a python notebook. The notebook contains a detailed description implementation of the network. The script contains the same implementation made to test different variables of the network, such as learning rate.
